      <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
      <p
        >Thanks for using our application. Please read the Terms of Use before
        using.  We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If
        we do so, we’ll let you know via emails. It’s important that you review
        the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the
        Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site or via the
        Services, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the
        modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms,
        then you may not use the App or the Services anymore. Because our
        Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any
        part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole
        discretion.

      <h3>General Terms </h3>
      <p
        >These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
        agreement between us and you regarding the Services and Content, and
        these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written
        understandings or agreements between us and you regarding the Services
        and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds
        any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision
        will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other
        provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may
        not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise,
        without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or
        transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. We may freely
        assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the
        foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the
        parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
      </p>
      <p
        >Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms,
        including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given:
        (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by
        email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice
        is transmitted. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these
        Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The
        waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in
        writing and signed by our duly authorized representative. Except as
        expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any
        of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
        remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
